"""Context-pruning middleware: bound image + OBS-text growth before each model call.

Per AGENTS.md (P0 #3): before every model call
this middleware runs two independent, idempotent passes over the transcript:

1. **Image pruning** — keep the image blocks of only the newest ``keep_images``
   image-bearing messages; older image blocks are replaced with a
   ``[screen#<n> 已剪除]`` text placeholder. This bounds token/latency growth
   from screenshots while preserving a textual trail of which screens existed.

2. **OBS marks folding** — keep the full ``marks (K): <digest>`` section of only
   the newest ``keep_marks`` ``[OBS]`` text blocks; older ones collapse to a
   one-line ``[OBS] app=X screen#N [marks 已折叠:K]`` placeholder. Marks-first
   grounding requires the model to address the *latest* observation's mark ids,
   so folding stale digests is safe and reinforces that discipline.

Both passes mutate message content in place and are idempotent: a placeholder
carries no image block and a folded line carries no ``marks (`` marker, so a
re-run leaves already-processed history byte-identical (stable prefix outside
the rolling window). Modified messages are returned once, deduped by identity,
so the ``add_messages`` reducer replaces them in place.

``ImagePruningMiddleware`` / ``build_image_middleware`` remain as compatibility
aliases for the pre-S1 image-only behaviour (keep newest 1).
