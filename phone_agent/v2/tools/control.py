"""Control tools: finish / ask_user / take_over.

Per AGENTS.md. These tools shape the run outcome rather than
touching the device. HITL interrupts for ``ask_user``/``take_over`` are enforced
by the safety middleware; the tool bodies only record intent / format text.

``finish`` enforces two fail-closed gates and a two-step review (S2 §1):

1. Non-empty ``evidence`` (list what was done + the on-screen proof).
2. TaskDoc guard (``AGENTS.md`` §2.4): open route
   items block the declaration.

Then, unless ``PHONE_AGENT_FINISH_VERIFY=off`` degrades it to the pre-two-step
single-call landing, ``finish`` is **two-step** (S2 §1): the first call returns a
*review packet* (a cheap L0 world-state mirror built by ``review.py`` — one
``observe()``) and does **not** land ``finished``; the model reflects and calls
``finish(confirm=true)`` to land it. A confirm is only honoured while the review
is still fresh (``screen_seq == finish_review_seq``); any intervening observation
invalidates the mirror and re-emits a fresh packet.

On a fresh confirm, an independent-context **verifier** (S2 §4, ``verify.py``) may
run — for a high-risk goal, a hard-contradiction confirm, or ``FINISH_VERIFY=always``.
A verifier REJECT is returned in-band (``finished`` stays False); the 2nd rejection
escalates to human takeover. The verifier is **fail-open**: any setup/call failure
lands the finish anyway (the L1 two-step already gated it).
